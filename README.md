Just run the Jupyter notebook.


To run trials:

Pass to the trial functions: K, the number of episodes to train over, and N, the number of agents to be averaged over.

Optionally, also pass additional arguments to alter the parameters of the RL algorithms (by default: Q=0, epsilon=0.01, alpha=0.01, gamma=1).
